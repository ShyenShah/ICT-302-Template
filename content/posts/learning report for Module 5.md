This week we learned about the difference between presentation and content. Presentation is how the content is laid out and pretty much is what it says, how the content is presented, based on colors, themes, and designs of the webpage. Content is created by editors, this is what the readers will read. One method of a making a site look appealing is to use CSS. When creating a website in HTMl it tends to be very bland, but using a CSS file adds flavor to the website which makes the site appealing to user and makes them want to come back.
