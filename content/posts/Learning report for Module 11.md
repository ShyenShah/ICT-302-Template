This week we learned about the different types of content shape and how they apply to differnt content structures. The different types of content shape are serial content, heiarchial content, network and tabular content. Content shape helps the content when there is more then one catagory the blog or wesbite is about. We learned that Canvas pretty much has all of these shapes and Hugo and WordPress typically have a serial content structure.

For our extra project this week we learned about Word Press permisions. These permisions allow different users with different roles to only focus on their own work whether it be the editor or developer adding media or content. This help for the CMS to be more organized and efficient.
