This week was the halfway mark through the semester. We learned how to give effective feedback to our peers especially since we were all working on multiple projects. Effective feedback is important to better everyones writing. There is always something that can be improved. It is important not to give vague feedback like "this is good" or "this needs to be improved". As we learned this week feedback should be given based on what the outcome is supposed to be and compared to it. Then feedback should be given based on what is lacking and what is exceling.


I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. - In one of the projects we were asked to defne a CMS concept in which we defined presentation.
I can describe and compare content management systems. - In the comparison of presentation I compared both how the presentation of Hugo and WordPress work.
I can manage content using established workflows. - We used workflows in Teams as usual to determine the jobs of each group member.
I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. - Teams was heavily used this week to communicate about the multiple projects.
