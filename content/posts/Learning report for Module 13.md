This week the conversation was about advertising. This is necessary for a CMS as it makes the content affordable for the company and the consumer. Advertisments can occur in many different formats. You can have sponsers, crowdfuding, paywalls, and much more. Not a lot of people like advertisments and I agree, but this is why we are able to watch hours of youtube for free or be able to search on the number 1 search engine without having to pay a single penny. Now a days advertisemetns have become more personalized as well to maybe even assist you, even tho some may say it is a invasion of privacy.

For the extra project this were able to see how to change the theme on Word Press and discuss how different colors can be used for different sites or presentations.



1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. - Learned about the different types of advertising and how a CMS can afford the content.
2. I can describe and compare content management systems. - Discussed the different types of advertisements a CMS can use and how they impact a users experience through the CMS.
3. I can manage content using established workflows. - Used Teams for the weekly blog post for manaing workflows.
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. - Use Teams chat to work on projects and meet with team.
