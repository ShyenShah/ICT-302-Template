#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
We have already learned so much halfway through this semster about Content Management Systems's. A Content Mangement System is defined as a computer software like Hugo or WordPress that gives you the ability to store and modify content. There are hundreds of other CMS's like online retail and other personal website creation tools. A good way to think of it is like a database but for any type of content.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
We have learned about and researched quite a few number of Content Management Systems, but have worked tons with 2. I have worked with Hugo and WordPress now. I would say that these are 2 fairly diffrent CMS's. Hugo is for more personal creation like a about you page and is way more user friendly and intuitie. This makes it better for a beginner to see how site development works and can add whatever content they would like. WordPress I would say can be used for personnal use but is alos widely used for proffessional uses as well. Many retail businesses or retauraunts use WordPress to make their business aware of. You do not need much experience with programming and can use exsisting templates but having knowlwdge of HTML and CSS enables you to customize your website even more. A lot of people use WordPress to post blogs as well whether it be for entertainment or as a job.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
Now that we have spent weeks with working with Hugo and WordPress I can confidently say that I would be able to create content using a CMS on my own. Weekly use of posting learning reports on Hugo and chaniging settings like the template as well as editing using Markdown has taught me another language as well as make me an intermediate user for Hugo. Creating additoinla pages and linking them to the home page was also benefiical in learning how a user likes to access pages and the importance about User Interface. Posting blogs to WordPress has also helped me lean about content managment since we have multiple pages on their for the multiple groups i our class.

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
Hugo and WordPress are some of the technologies we have used but the big one I think is Teams. I would say that Microsoft Teams is very related to a Content Mangement System since you can post on their, coloborate with each other, save files ont thier, and create workflows when working on a team to meet dealines. Without using this piece of technology I believe it would have been very hard to collobarate about projects and assignments in this class. This was also a great way to learn about Teams since it is being used in the work force today.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
Other then using lectures as resources there was a lot of looking stuff up as well, especially when it came HTML elemnts. A good source I used for learning about HTML was https://www.w3schools.com/.
