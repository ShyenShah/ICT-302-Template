This week we discussed on how to differenciate on what type of CMS is required per needs of a blog. For example if I was doing a blog post on new tech I would definitely need a CMS that can handle images and tables/charts. It is always important to choose a CMS based on all of the features. a CMS may have a wonderful feature that you like but the rest of it would be terrible. There is a fine balance on what features you should sacrifice other functionality for and what you absolutely must need.

1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. - Functionlaity is the number 1 aspect of of designing a blg in a CMS.
2. I can describe and compare content management systems. - I can differenciate what type of CMS I require for specific blogs.
3. I can manage content using established workflows. - Used Teams to gather with group and discuss thisweeks topic.
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. - Used software like Hugo and Word Press to create blogs.
