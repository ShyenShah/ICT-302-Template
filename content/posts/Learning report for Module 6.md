This week we were intorduced to WordPress, another website hosting service like Hugo. WordPress seems like it is more proffesional and has more user control over the site which I really prefer. Although Hugo is easier to use I really like WordPress becuase everything can be done from one interface and can create more proffesional looking stes as well as gain experience for the real world.

Learning Outcomes Completed:
1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. - WordPress is a CMS tool used by indusry proffesionals.
2. I can describe and compare content management systems. - Compared the differences between Hugo and WordPreess.
3. I can manage content using established workflows. - Used Teams to continue with the blog post assignment
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. - Used WordPress as well as Teams this week to post Blog Posts.
5. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. - Looked at a few user manuals for WordPress
