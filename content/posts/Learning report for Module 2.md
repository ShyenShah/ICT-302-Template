This week we learned about Markdown language. It is similar to HTML but not quite as I leanred this from expermenting with the code in GitHub. The learning outcome for this week was "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning
" as we used writen lectures and other websites to figure out how to add pages and content to our Hugo webiste. We also learned how to link another page onto hour home page as well as add a picture onto our webpage. Additionally I learned what new tags mean and new formats in coding.
