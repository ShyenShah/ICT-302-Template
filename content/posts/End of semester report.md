During this class I learned a lot about Content Management Systems. We slowly defined each part of that definition by breaking it up into parts while working different technologies and with other people and a bunch of new systems. In this report I will describe step by step on the accomplishments in this class. We separated the class into 5 I can statements meaning all of them will be covered in the duration of the semester either in lectures or hands-on learning.

#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management:

Over the semester we learned many concepts in web content management. The first thing we learned was about content. Content is information that is created for a specific type of audience. An example of content is news articles. There are millions of people who read them every day and they are different based on the topic which make it custom for. Specific type of audience to read. Choosing the type of system is also important in this process. You have to account for cost and usability. Something may be expensive and you my thing it must have all the feature your company needs, but in reality, it may not, and the cheaper option may have it. You also want to look at the user interface of the CMS you select. It is important to have something that is easy to understand and use so when it comes to producing content, your focus can just shift to that. Another aspect that is very important is the presentation of your content. While content is what the words or data means, presentation is how all of this looks like including graphic. You want your audience to come bac and read your blog or visit your website, so you want the user experience to be as best as possible. This could range all the way from having a certain color scheme to having different features and a interface the user can experience. This can also include the organization of content like having graphs and charts.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems:

Content Management is defined as the practice of organizing, publishing, and delivering content. In Web Content Management there are multiple roles and tasks such as Editors, Planners, Admins, and Stakeholders. Having different roles makes it easier to come out through quality content. Some of the Content Management Systems we have used is Hugo WordPress, and I count Microsoft Teams as well. WordPress was used for the team weekly blog posts. This was the best representation of a CMS team and was very similar to real world experience. Having different roles such as admin, developers, and editors helped us get the work done efficiently as well as figure out how all of these roles depend on each other and what they do. Hugo is also a CMS and was used for the individual weekly learning reports. This gave us some hands-on programming skills with Markdown and HTML as well as using GitHub which is also a sort of a CMS for managing written code and programs.

#### I can manage content using established workflows

Workflows are a framework to move content through a defined set of steps. Workflows are needed to figure out what each person’s responsibilities are and when their deadlines are. In this class we used Microsoft Teams for creating Workflows. Every week for our blog posts we created a Workflow and a different bucket for each week in Teams to have everyone on the same page and making it clear on each person’s roles and when it is due by. This was very helpful in our process every week. In addition to this we also created a Workflow document stating the same thing but in more detail every week based on what our exact topic will be and what part they will write about.


#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management

In this class we used a wide variety of technologies that would be used in today’s workforce. As discussed above in detail we used WordPress and Hugo as out main Content Management Systems. We used Teams as a means of Communication and creating a Workflow. One other technology we used was hypothesis. This is a plug-in software that allows other students as well as the professor to ask and answer questions within the article as well as make comments that provides a different view on the article. Plug-ins is something else we discussed in class, these are typically pieces of software thar perform a task that is unable to be done directly within the website. There are multiple types of plug-ins, for example something simple to submitting comments all the way to accepting payments.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning

This class did require some outside learning other than the provided lectures. The main research I had to do to complete some assignments was for the code. I used a website called W3 schools which provided a lot of examples on how Markdown and HTML works. This was helpful for me since I could never memorize the exact code itself when I wouldn’t to do something.
