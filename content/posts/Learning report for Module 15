This week we learned and reviewed how to give proper feedback that is beneficial to the writer. Good feedback is not critiism but it is stuff that the writer can work on and improve over time. It is also important to be constructive and and say what things can be added and compare the requirements of the paper to the actual content, thats how you know you have quality content for your target audience.

1. I can manage content using established workflows. - Used Teams for the weekly blog post for manaing workflows.
2. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. - Use Teams chat to work on projects and meet with team.
