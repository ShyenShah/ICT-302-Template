This week we learned about Content Management Workflows and how they can be beneficial in completing projects. The process of this is called Kanban, delegating tasks and setting timelines for tasks that need to be accomplished. For this we used a plug-in called planner in Microsoft Teams to complete group Blog Posts. Usally there are different roles in these projects like Editors, Developers, and Administrators. We have organized a plan on how to go abput completing tasks every week and who will have what role and when it needs to get done by. 

This week we also completed a few I can statements.
1. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. - Here we learned how to use Teams and Planner to create a workflow.
2. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. - Here I looked up some syntax for markdown to create this Blog Post.
3. I can manage content using established workflows. - This is where we cretaed our channel in Teams and created a Workflow.
