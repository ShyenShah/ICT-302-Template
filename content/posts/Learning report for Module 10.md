This week in lecture we learned about content modeling. Content modeling is how content types, objects and data types help create the content. A content type is pretty much how it sounds, it is the method in which you are recieving the content such as a news artlice a blog or a form. These forms have specific attributes. Attributes is what the form asks for in terms on information or content. For example, this could be your name, gender, address, phone number, date, social security number, etc. You also have data types for every attribute. For example names usually do not consist of numbers so it would be safe to have this input as text only. However a phone number does not consist of characters only numbers so it would be safe to have a data type limit to numbers only and a 10 digit input. The date is also a data type in itself since forms usually ask for the date in a specific format like MM/DD/YYYY. Data types reminds me of programming since you always have to specify what type of value a variable can accept.


1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. - This week we leanred about content modeling and attributes in a CMS.
2. I can describe and compare content management systems. - We compared what attributes Hugo and Word Press ask for when you are crating a post suchs as title, date, author, and wheter it is a draft or not.
3. I can manage content using established workflows. - Our workflow is usually contained within Teams every week when creating our blog post.
4. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. - As usual we used Hugo for our individual learning report, Word Press for our weekly blog post, and Teams for communication and planning of our blog post.
