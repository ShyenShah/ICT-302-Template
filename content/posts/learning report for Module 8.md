This week we larned about a lot about the different CMS's that are out there and how to know it is the right one for you. FOr exmaple, I learned that it is very important to have features that you will use rather then flashy features that you will rarely use especially when you are paying for them. I looked at Wix and shopify this week. Wix is very similar to WordPress and have heard a lot of people use it for personal and business use. Shopify is used for online retail businesses and can help with a user to keep track of sales and can help advertise the business.
