This week we implemented what technologies we will be using in ICT 302. We set up accounts with GitHub, Hugo, and Netlify to be able to make blog posts in our own website. I think it is very interesting how we are incorporating technical skills in this class. We get to build onto our own website as well as kind of see how the code in the background works. I think this is way more interactive and helpful for the future rather then submitting word documents all the time.
