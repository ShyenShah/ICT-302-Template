This week we learned how to add multiple pages and links in Hugo as well as refresed on how to add an image. We also got to the full defiintion of a Content Management Ststem. A CMS is a system in which content can be saved and worked/developed on. This usually requires servers and databases as well as editiors and programmers to make everything happen.

This week we also completed a few I can statements.
1. I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. - As we discussed in the blog post, i felt like that the IT aspect inclusing servers and databses is the most important for a CMS.
2. I can describe and compare content management systems. - We learned about how their can be multiple CMSs such as a learning CMS like Canvas and other ones lile asset management systems.
3. I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. - We learned how Hugo is sort of an CMS but there are certainly other better ones.
4. I can find and use resources for self-directed learning. - While reading today's article I thought about how we used an asset managemnt system during my internship. It reminded me that this is exaclty a CMS, since computers and other devices and names are the content and it is managed by the IT people as well as backed by servers and online databases.
